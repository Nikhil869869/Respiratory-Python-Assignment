# ðŸ§  Python Beginner Assignments â€“ Theory & String Logic

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python assignments:

- **Assignment 1**: Python theory and basic syntax Q&A
- **Assignment 2**: String indexing, slicing, and manipulation using user input

These assignments help build a strong foundation in Python programming, covering both conceptual understanding and hands-on string operations.

### ðŸ§ª Assignment 2: String Indexing & Slicing
- Accepting user input (names, numbers, text)
- Swapping first and last names using indexing
- Removing spaces with `.strip()`, `.replace()`, and `" ".join()`
- String slicing tasks like:
  - Reverse every second character â†’ `[::-2]`
