# 🧠 Python Indexing & Slicing Assignment

This repository contains two Python assignments that focus on **string indexing, slicing, and user input manipulation** using basic Python functions. These tasks are designed to strengthen your logic and string handling skills — useful for data cleaning, text formatting, and beginner-level automation.

## 📚 Assignments Covered

### ✅ Assignment 1 Highlights:
- Accept a full name from the user and **swap first and last name** using indexing
- Use `.strip()`, `.replace()`, and `.title()` to clean and format name inputs
- Print characters of a string using **positive and negative indexing**
- Display outputs using `.format()` and `print()`

### ✅ Assignment 2 Highlights:
- Demonstrate string **slicing operations** like:
  - `[::-2]` → Reverse every second character
  - `[3:-3]` → Exclude first 3 and last 3 characters
  - `s.replace(" ", "")` → Remove all spaces from a string
- Take numbers and strings as input from the user
- Practice real-life use cases like reversing names, formatting labels, and cleaning data

## 🔍 Skills Practiced

- String Indexing (`s[0]`, `s[-1]`, etc.)
- String Slicing (`s[::]`, `s[::-1]`, `s[3:-3]`)
- String Methods:
  - `.strip()`
  - `.replace()`
  - `.title()`
  - `.format()`
- Handling user input with `input()`
- Reversing and formatting names

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` files in **Jupyter Notebook**, **Google Colab**, or **VS Code**.
3. Run each cell and follow the comments/instructions.
4. Try experimenting with different string inputs to explore more.

## 🎯 Purpose

These assignments are beginner-friendly and crafted to help you:
- Practice common string operations in Python
- Understand how slicing and indexing help extract or reverse string data
- Clean and format user input (like names, text, numbers)
- Build confidence for real-world data preprocessing and logic building
